# HyperFleet Pull Secret Service - Design Decision Record

---

## Executive Summary

The **HyperFleet Pull Secret Service** is a cloud-agnostic credential management service that generates, stores, and rotates container registry pull secrets for HyperFleet-managed clusters. This design lifts and shifts proven logic from the AMS (UHC Account Manager) pull secret implementation, adapting it for HyperFleet's multi-cloud, adapter-driven architecture.
